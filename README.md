# Honey Do List
*Honey Do List* is a Node/Express JS app using Handlebars, mySQL and Sequelize that allows the user to input a task (a 'do') then mark it completed.

You can run the app on [Heroku](https://tranquil-journey-54558.herokuapp.com/).

Note: the database is not just used for you, but for all. So keep your tasks clean! (If you want it all for yourself, fork it. :D)

 You can find the source files at [https://github.com/mathfour/honeydo](https://github.com/mathfour/honeydo)

## How to Use the App: Create a DO, then DO it!

Fill out a task (a DO) and click *Add this DO to the List*. Your DO will show up on the left. Click the *This DO is Done!* button and it will be marked completed - and put in the Done DOs column!
